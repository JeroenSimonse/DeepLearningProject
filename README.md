# General info

This project was part of our Deep Learning course and consisted of the following tasks:
1. Text classification
	* Is a sentence original English or translated from French to English by using a Neural Network model
2. Format the predictions in a text file 

The model that was constructed for this project, was a Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Network. 
This was a group project. 

# Technologies
The project is coded in: Python V3.7

Using the following libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* keras
* scipy
* sklearn
* collections 

Tools that were used:
Google colab

# Usage
The predictions are saved in a seperate txt file, that is formatted in a specific way due to grading purposes. 

# Note
The model achieved an accuracy of 75,5%.
